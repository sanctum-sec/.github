### [LLM Behavioral Fingerprinting](https://github.com/sanctum-sec/llm-behavioral-fingerprinting)

Investigating behavioral asymmetries in AI systems—how models from different origins respond to geopolitically sensitive prompts, exhibit implicit biases, and can be fingerprinted through their outputs.

**Experiments:**
- **The Peking Duck Paradox** — A Chinese model that refuses to help Chinese institutions
- **The Mathematicians' War** — Multi-agent roleplay revealing cross-provider behavioral differences
